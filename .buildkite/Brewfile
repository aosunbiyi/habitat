# This Brewfile is for setting up and managing the small amount of
# Homebrew-related infrastructure we need. As our MacOS build process
# matures, we can whittle this down.

# Though our builders will already have this installed, we can take
# advantage of the Brewfile to ensure that we've got the latest
# version of hab installed. There are other ways to do this, of
# course, but none that take 2 lines of code.
tap "habitat-sh/habitat"
brew "hab"

# Our builders currently have Bash 3.2.57 installed, but our Habitat
# package build process requires a more modern version. The Linux
# build currently uses Bash 4.3.42, and Homebrew currently brings in
# 4.4.23.
#
# Until our builders have a modern Bash installed, we'll just bring our
# own.
brew "bash"

# Eventually we'll get wget in our Omnibus toolchain, but it's rather
# finickly to get compiled for MacOS. Until that time, we'll pull it
# in from Homebrew.
brew "wget"

# We'll keep these directives here until we have an Omnibus toolchain
# that includes rq.
